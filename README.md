## Week March 20th
- Receive the formula of CowVal formula and calculate the value
- Compare the result with the Matlab Code
- Read the paper and get the ME 305 formula

## Week April 1th
- Apply concurrent programming on the model
- Improve the running efficiency of the model
- Log into HTC
- Create ME 305 function
- Create a new column cumulate the value of the milk production

## Week April 10th
- Change the sorting order of the herd(line:490) [9->10]
- Rank the Cow by the value of herd (The value of NPV go up by approximately 300-400)
- Try to run it on HTC
- Fix the bug of Exponential Function
